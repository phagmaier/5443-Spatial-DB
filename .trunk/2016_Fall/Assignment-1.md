##Assignment 1 - Establishing Contact

#### Due: Tuesday Jun 3rd by 12:20
<br><br>

We will be using github this semester as a means of communicating, and storing documents (assignments and programs). 	

#### Create a Github account. 
- When you create a Github account, you must choose a `username`. 
- This is very important to remember, because you will email it to me in the next part of this assignment.
- Create a repository named something similar to our course, like `spatial-databases`.
- Add me: `rugbyprof` as a collaborator to your repository. You can do this in the settings of your repository.

#### Send me an email:

- `To`: terry.griffin@mwsu.edu
- `Subject`: Spatial Databases - Assignment 1

Hello Professor Griffin,<br><br>
My Name is: place your name here<br>
My Github username is: githubusername


#### Login to cs2 server:

- Your username will be FirstinitialLastname. For example `Joe Smith` would be `jsmith`.
- Your password to log in to the system will be a random password I send to you via email. You should then login to the system via `putty`.
- Immediately after login, change your password using the `passwd` command if you want.
- Access the Mysql database with following url: (http://cs2.mwsu.edu/phpMyAdmin)
- Login to PhpMyadmin using your username and the password that I email to you (it's the same as the system login). If you change your system password, it won't effect your mysql password. Your stuck with the one I give you.
